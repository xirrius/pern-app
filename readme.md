# Authentication and Authorization using jwt

### To learn
1. jwt 
2. bcrypt
3. connecting client and server

### Keep in mind
Client is running on localhost:3000 and server is running on localhost:5000
Both are not the same, this is why we need cors.
When sending request to server, ensure that you are using the correct url

### in server folder
1. Run "npm i"
2. Run "nodemon index.js"

### in client folder
1. Run "npm i"
2. Run "npm start"
